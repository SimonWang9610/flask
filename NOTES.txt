1) before run the application, database must be initialized
2) 'Role' table must be created before new users register, otherwise they can not get the right permission
3) one user start following others, it should update the 'User.add_self_follow()' in 'flask shell'

#1) Creating functions that introduce updates to the database is a common technique
    used to update applications that are deployed, as running a scripted update is less
    error prone than updating databases manually.

#2) app/models.py (User.followed_posts) the relationship of join operation in this database should
       1. filter by follower_id, which means we should choose those users followed by current_user
       2. get posts by followed_id, which means we should get posts of those users followed by current_user
